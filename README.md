# Veternary Clinic
 > In this, I have used a relational database to create the data structure for a veternary clinic with data about:
 > animals
 > animals' owners
 > clinic employees
 > visits


## Getting Started
This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:
- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
